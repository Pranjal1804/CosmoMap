# CosmoMap: AI-Powered Tactical Object Detection System

## Overview

CosmoMap is an advanced computer vision system designed for automated detection and analysis of tactical objects and equipment in aerial reconnaissance imagery. The system combines state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models with an interactive web-based interface for real-time analysis and geographical visualization.

The system is specifically engineered for edge computing environments where rapid tactical assessment is critical, providing immediate object detection capabilities for military vehicles, personnel, aircraft, and strategic infrastructure.

3. Validate model performance on test datasets
4. Deploy trained models to `python-backend/models/`

### Adding Detection Classes
Modify the class mapping in `python-backend/main.py`:
```python
class_names = {
    0: "tank",
    1: "military_vehicle",
    2: "personnel",
    3: "ship",
    4: "tennis-court"
}
```

### UI Customization
Frontend components are modular and can be extended:
- `MapContainer.tsx`: Geospatial visualization
- `DetectionList.tsx`: Results display
- `StatsCard.tsx`: Metrics dashboard

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check model loading
cd python-backend && python load_mode.py
